```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read arguments and loadings

```{r loading}
options(warn=-1)

aggregated_path = paste(params$input_path, '/aggregated_object', sep = '')
output_path = paste(params$input_path, '/aggregated_object_analyzed_unfiltered', sep = '')

library(Seurat)
library(dplyr)

load(file = aggregated_path)
```

## Normalize with cell cycle effect removal

```{r normalize}
aggregated_samples = PercentageFeatureSet(aggregated_samples, pattern = "^MT-", col.name = "percent.mt")
aggregated_samples = SCTransform(aggregated_samples, verbose = FALSE)
aggregated_samples = RunPCA(aggregated_samples)
```

## Find principal components

```{r components}
aggregated_samples = JackStraw(aggregated_samples, num.replicate = 100, dims = 50, verbose = FALSE)
aggregated_samples = ScoreJackStraw(aggregated_samples, dims = 1:50)
jackstraw_pvalues = data.frame(aggregated_samples@reductions$pca@jackstraw$overall.p.values)

for (i in 1:dim(jackstraw_pvalues)[1]) {
  if (jackstraw_pvalues$Score[i] > 0.05) {
    PC_number = i - 1
    break
  }
}

ElbowPlot(aggregated_samples, ndims = 50)
JackStrawPlot(aggregated_samples, dims = 1:50)
```

## Clustering and visualize

```{r clustering}
aggregated_samples <- FindNeighbors(aggregated_samples, dims = 1:PC_number)
aggregated_samples <- FindClusters(aggregated_samples)
VlnPlot(aggregated_samples, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"), group.by = 'orig.ident', ncol = 3, pt.size = 0)

aggregated_samples <- RunTSNE(aggregated_samples, dims = 1:PC_number)
aggregated_samples <- RunUMAP(aggregated_samples, dims = 1:PC_number)

DimPlot(aggregated_samples, reduction = "pca", group.by = "orig.ident")
DimPlot(aggregated_samples, reduction = "tsne", group.by = "orig.ident")
DimPlot(aggregated_samples, reduction = "umap", group.by = "orig.ident")
FeaturePlot(aggregated_samples, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt"))
```

## Differential expression

```{r differential_expression}
Idents(object = aggregated_samples) <- "orig.ident"
list_sample_names = as.vector(unique((aggregated_samples@active.ident)))
for (sample in list_sample_names) {
  markers <- FindMarkers(aggregated_samples, ident.1 = sample)
  print(sample)
  head(markers, n = 10)
}

aggregated_samples_markers = FindAllMarkers(aggregated_samples, only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
top10 = aggregated_samples_markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_logFC)
DoHeatmap(aggregated_samples, features = top10$gene) + NoLegend()
```

## Save file

```{r saving}
save(aggregated_samples, file = output_path)
```
