# NIBSC Bioinformatics Core Pipelines

In this repository you can find all the code used/developed by NIBSC Bioinformatics Core for the analyses we offer to the different research groups in the institute.

## Executing the scripts

Under each workflow, you will find more detailed pipeline-specific instructions.
As a general principle, our GitHub repositories should be cloned under **~/CODE/.** (i.e. a folder named *CODE* under your user home): this will make sure you can run the code in the exact same way locally, on the cloud or an HPC environment, independently of the user.
